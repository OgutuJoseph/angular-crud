### To avoid the error message

- Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)

#### Go to the appsettings.json and add the below to the connection string
- > TrustServerCertificate=True;

As

- > "AngularCrudConnectionString": "server=IBSKE00494\\SQLEXPRESS;database=AngularCrudDb;Trusted_Connection=true;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
